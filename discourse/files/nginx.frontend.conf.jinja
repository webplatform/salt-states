# This is the PUBLIC virtual host for discuss.{{ tld }}
#
# Note that we call another NGINX virtual host, from the internal network,
# without SSL, and with a different name than the publicly exposed.
#
# Intention is that we can have multiple internal upstreams load-balanced
# by this very virtual host.
